# Survey-Reporting
Script to perform data import, manipulation, and reporting on survey data using Cell Weighting

## Weighting Methodology ##
Cell weighting, as implemented in the provided Python script, involves the application of weights to individual observations based on specific combinations of categorical variables, namely gender and age categories. Unlike iterative processes, the script employs a direct cell weighting approach to refine weights without multiple iterations.

Initial Weight Assignment:

Initial weights are assigned to each observation based on predetermined demographic factors, such as gender and age groups.
The script begins by calculating weights by multiplying the weights associated with gender and age categories.
Sampling Adjustment and Cell Weighting:

Cell weighting is applied to adjust these initial weights based on the observed distribution of gender and age categories in the survey data.
The adjustment process aims to align the distribution of specific demographic groups with predetermined targets, mitigating biases associated with non-response and selection.
Target Distribution:

External targets are not explicitly defined in this script, as it assumes a direct weighting approach without iterations.
The emphasis is on aligning the observed distribution with the predetermined weights for gender and age categories.
Precision and Control:

The direct cell weighting approach provides a high degree of precision and control over the final weights assigned to observations.
Users can precisely define weights for gender and age categories, tailoring adjustments to specific demographic criteria.
Impact on Final Sample:

The final weights, refined through cell weighting, are applied to the survey data during sampling.
Each observation contributes to the analysis based on the adjusted weights, ensuring that the distribution of gender and age categories aligns with the predetermined weights.
Flexibility and Simplicity:

The script offers flexibility by allowing users to define weights for gender and age categories directly.
The approach is straightforward, making it accessible to users with diverse statistical backgrounds.
By incorporating cell weighting into the weighting scheme, the script enables researchers to tailor adjustments to specific demographic criteria, providing flexibility and control over the survey's outcome. This direct approach simplifies the weighting process, making it accessible and precise for users aiming to address biases associated with gender and age categories in survey sampling.
